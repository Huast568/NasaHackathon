Our mission is to give everyone the privilege of appreciating the vastness and wonders of the universe. At the end of the day, we all live under the same night sky, and it would be our teamâ€™s greatest wish for that sky to be what connects communities and families; maybe inspiring a young mind to become an astronaut, astrophysicist, or astronomer along the way.")
